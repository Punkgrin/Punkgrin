Hey there!
To those who read this, welcome to what will probably be one of the tastiest looking italian restaurants out there, cause you're gonna see a lot of spaghetti.
I'm a part-time game developer, who, to some of your dismay, is not in the mood for collaboration at the moment, but eventually when I become a tad more serious, we may see it happen. Depends.
/* update; collaboration is possible, just anticipate a no as to not get your hopes up, though i have no idea why you would even have your hopes up in the first place, as i have no idea what im doing. if that's the type of person you wanna work with, come say hi. */

Cheers,

-Punkgrin Pie
