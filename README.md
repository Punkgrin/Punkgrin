Hey there!
To those who read this, welcome to what will probably be one of the tastiest looking italian restaurants out there, cause you're gonna see a lot of spaghetti.
I'm a part-time game developer, who, to some of your dismay, is not in the mood for collaboration at the moment, but eventually when I become a tad more serious, we may see it happen. Depends.

Cheers,
